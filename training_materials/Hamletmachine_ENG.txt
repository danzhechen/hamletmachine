I was Hamlet.  I stood at the coast and spoke with the surf BLABLA, behind me the ruins 
of Europe.  The bells rang in the state funeral, murderer and widow a pair, the council in 
goose-step behind the coffin of the High Cadaver, howling in poorly paid grief WHOSE 
IS THE CORPSE IN THE CORPSE TRAIN/ FOR WHOM IS HEARD THIS 
LAMENTING  STRAIN/ THE CORPSE IS OF A GREAT/ GIVER OF ESTATE the 
framework of the people, work of his statecraft HE WAS A MAN TOOK THEM ALL 
FOR ALL.  I stopped the funeral train, pried open the casket with my sword which broke 
the blade, with the blunt remainder I succeeded and distributed my dead maker FLESH 
AND FLESH GLADLY JOIN TOGETHER before the surrounding guise of misery.  The 
grief turned to rejoicing, the rejoicing into smacking, on top of the empty casket the 
murderer mounted the widow SHOULD I HELP YOU UP UNCLE OPEN YOUR LEGS  
MAMA.  I laid on the ground and heard the world turning her rounds in step with the 
decay. 
I’M GOOD HAMLET GI’ME A CAUSE FOR GRIEF *

LIKE A HUNCHBACK I DRAG MY HEAVY BRAIN  
SECOND CLOWN IN THE SPRING OF COMMUNISM 
SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN THIS AGE OF HOPE* 
LET’S DELVE IN EARTH AND BLOW HER AT THE MOON * 
Here comes the ghost that made me, the axe still in the skull.  You can keep your hat on, I 
know you’ve got one hole too many.  I would my mother had one too few when you were 
in the flesh:  I’d have been spared.  Women should be sewn shut, a world without 
mothers.  We could slaughter each other in peace, and with a bit of confidence, if life 
becomes too long for us or our throats too tight for our screams.  What do you want from 
me?  Is one state funeral not enough for you, old deadbeat?   Do you have no blood on 
your shoes?  What do I care about your corpse?  Be happy that the handle is sticking out; 
perhaps you’ll go to heaven.  What are you waiting for?  The cocks have been 
slaughtered.  Morning is cancelled. 
SHALL I 
BECAUSE IT’S CUSTOMARY STICK A PIECE OF IRON  IN 
THE NEAREST FLESH OR THE NEXT NEAREST

LORD BREAK MY NECK WHEN I FALL FROM 
AN ALEHOUSE BENCH  
 
Enter Horatio.  Confidant  of my thoughts so full of blood since morning is curtained by 
the empty sky.  YOU COME TOO LATE MY FRIEND FOR YOUR PAYCHECK / NO 
SPACE FOR YOU IN MY TRAGEDY PLAY.  Horatio, do you know me?  Are you my

friend, Horatio?  If you know me, how can you be my friend?  Do you want to play 
Polonius, who wants to sleep with his daughter, the charming Ophelia, she comes on her 
cue line, see how she shakes her ass, a tragic role.  HoratioPolonius.  I knew you were an 
actor.  I am too, I play Hamlet.  Denmark is a prison, between us grows a wall.  Look at 
what’s growing out of the wall.  Exit Polonius.  My mother the bride.  Her breasts a bed 
of roses, her womb a nest of snakes.  Have you forgotten your text, Mama?  I’ll prompt: 
WASH THE MURDER OFF YOUR FACE MY PRINCE/ AND MAKE EYES AT THE 
NEW DENMARK.  I’ll make you into a virgin again, Mother, so that the king can have a 
bloody wedding.  THE MOTHER’S WOMB IS NOT A ONEWAY STREET.  Now, I tie 
your hands behind your back with your bridal veil since I’m disgusted by your embrace.  
Now, I tear apart the wedding dress.  Now you must scream.  Now I smear the rags of 
your wedding dress with the earth my Father has become, with the rags your face your 
belly your breasts.  Now, I take you, my mother, in his, my father’s invisible tracks.  I 
strangle your scream with my lips.  Do you recognize the fruit of your body?  Now go to 
your wedding, whore, bright in the Danish sun which shines on the living and the dead.  I 
want to stuff the corpse in the toilet so that the palace chokes in kingly shit.  Then let me 
eat your heart, Ophelia, which cries my tears.

THE EUROPE OF WOMAN 
Enormous room.*  Ophelia.  Her heart is a clock. 
 
OPHELIA [CHORUS/HAMLET]

I am Ophelia.  The one the river didn’t keep.  The woman at the gallows The woman with 
sliced arteries The woman with the overdose SNOW ON HER LIPS The woman with her 
head in the gas oven.  Yesterday I stopped killing myself.  I am alone with my breasts my 
thighs my womb.  I smash the instruments of my imprisonment the chair the table the 
bed.  I destroy the battlefield that was my home.  I rip open the doors so the wind can 
come in and the cries of the world.  I smash the window.  With my bloody hands I tear 
the photographs of the men I loved who used me on the bed on the table on the chair on 
the floor.  I set fire to my prison.  I throw my clothes into the fire.  I unearth the clock that 
was my heart from my breast.  I go onto the street dressed in my blood.

SCHERZO  
University of the dead.  Whispers and murmurs.  From out of their gravestones (lecterns) 
the dead philosophers throw their books at Hamlet.  Gallery (ballet) of dead women.  The 
woman at the rope The woman with the sliced arteries, etc.  Hamlet regards them with 
the attitude of a museum (theater) visitor.  The dead women rip the clothing from his 
body.  From an upright coffin with the inscription HAMLET 1 step Claudius and, dressed 
and painted like a whore, Ophelia.  Striptease by Ophelia. 
 
OPHELIA  
Do you want to eat my heart, Hamlet.  Laughs.

HAMLET hands in front of his face: 
I want to be a woman. 
 
Hamlet puts on Ophelia’s clothes.  Ophelia paints a whore’s mask for him, Claudius, 
now Hamlet’s father, laughs without a sound, Ophelia blows Hamlet a kiss and steps 
back into the coffin with Claudius/Hamlet Father.  Hamlet in whore’s pose.  An angel, his 
face on the back of his head:  Horatio.  He dances with Hamlet. 
 
VOICE(S) from the coffin: 
What you killed you should also love. 
 
The dance becomes quicker and wilder.  Laughter from the casket.  On a swing, a 
madonna with breast cancer/crab.  Horatio opens an umbrella, embraces Hamlet.  
Freeze in the embrace under the umbrella.  The breast cancer radiates like a sun.

HAMLET ACTOR 
I am not Hamlet.  I don’t play a role anymore.  My words have nothing more to tell me.  
My thoughts suck the blood out of the images.  My drama is cancelled.  Behind me the 
set is being built.  By people my drama doesn’t interest, for people it doesn’t concern.  It 
doesn’t interest me anymore either.  I won’t play along anymore.  Unnoticed by the 
Hamlet Actor, stagehands arrange a refrigerator and three television sets.  Sounds of the 
refrigerator.  Three television programs without sound.  The set is a monument.  It 
depicts a man who made history, a hundred times enlarged.  The petrifaction of a hope.  
His name is interchangeable.  The hope didn’t come true.  The monument lies on the 
ground, razed by those who succeeded him in power three years after the state funeral of 
the hated and worshipped one.  The stone is inhabited.  In the spacious nose- and ear-
holes, creases of skin and uniform of the smashed statue dwells the poor population of the 
metropolis.  The uprising comes at an appropriate time after the collapse of the 
monument.  My drama, if it would still take place, would happen in the time of the 
uprising.  The uprising starts as a stroll.  Against traffic regulation, during working hours.

The street belongs to the pedestrians.  Here and there, a car is turned over.  Nightmare of 
a knife-thrower:  slow drive down a one-way street to an irrevocable parking space 
surrounded by armed pedestrians.  Policemen, if they stood in the way, are swept to the 
roadside.  When the train nears the government district it is stopped by a police line.  
Groups form, out of which speakers arise.  On the balcony of a government building a 
man in badly fitting clothes appears and begins to speak.  When the first stone hits him, 
he retreats behind the double doors of the bullet-proof glass.  The call for more freedom 
becomes the cry for the collapse of the government.  They start to disarm the police, 
storm two, three buildings, a prison a police station an office of the secret police, hang a 
dozen of the rulers’ henchmen by their feet, the government appoints troops, tanks.  My 
place, if my drama would still take place, would be on both sides of the front, between 
the fronts, beyond them.  I stand in the sweaty stench of the crowd and throw rocks at the 
police soldiers tanks bulletproof glass.  I look through the double doors of bullet-proof 
glass at the crowd moving forward and smell the sweat of my fear.  Choked by nausea, I 
shake my fist at myself who stands behind the bullet-proof glass.  Shaken by fright and 
contempt, I see myself in the oncoming mass, foaming at the mouth, shaking my fist at 
myself.  I hang up my uniformed flesh by my feet.  I am the soldier in the gun-turret, my 
head is empty under the helmet, the scream choked under the chains.  I am the typewriter.  
I tie the noose when the ringleaders are hanged, I pull away the stool, I break my own 
neck.  I am my own prisoner.  I feed the computer my data.  My roles are spit and 
spittoon knife and wound tooth and throat neck and rope.  I am the databank.  Bleeding in 
the crowd.  Breathing again behind the double doors.  Secreting word slime into my 
soundproof speech bubble over the battle.  My drama didn’t happen.  The script has been

lost.  The actors hung up their faces on the nails in the dressing room.  In his box the 
prompter festers.  The stuffed corpses in the house don’t move a hand.  I go home and kill 
time, at one/with my undivided self. 
Television the daily nausea Nausea 
At prefabricated babble 
At decreed cheerfulness 
How do you spell GEMÜTLICHKEIT  
Give us this day our daily murder 
For thine is the nothingness Nausea 
At the lies that are believed 
By the liars and no one else Nausea 
At the lies that are believed Nausea 
At the marked faces of the manipulators 
By their struggle for the positions votes bank accounts 
Nausea a scythed chariot with sparkling points. 
I go through streets supermarkets faces 
With the scars from the consumer battle poverty 
Without dignity poverty without dignity 
Of the knife the knuckles the fist 
The humiliated bodies of women 
Hope of generations 
Stifled n blood cowardice ignorance 
Laughter from dead bellies

Hail COCA COLA

THE KING OFFERED  ME HIS THIRD CONCUBINE  
I KNEW EVERY BIRTHMARK ON HER  HIPS RASKOLNIKOV AT HEART 
UNDER THE ONLY COAT THE AXE FOR THE/ONLY/SKULL OF THE

In the loneliness of the airports 
I breathe again I am 
A privileged person My nausea 
Is a privilege  
Sheltered by walls 
Barbed wire prison 
Photograph of the author. 
I don’t want to eat drink breathe love a woman a man a child an animal anymore. 
I don’t want to die anymore.  I don’t want to kill anymore. 
Tearing of the author’s photograph. 
I break open my sealed up flesh.  I want to live in my veins, in the marrow of my bones, 
in the labyrinth of my skull.  I retreat into my intestines.  I take a seat in my shit, my 
blood.  Somewhere bodies are being broken so I can live in my shit.  Somewhere bodies 
are opened so I can be alone with my blood.  My thoughts are lesions in my brain.  My 
brain is a scar.  I want to be a machine.  Arms to grab legs to go no pain no thoughts.

bandages.

Here speaks Electra.  In the heart of darkness.  Under the sun of torture.  To the cities of 
the world.  In the name of the victims.  I reject all of the semen that I received.  I turn the 
milk of my breasts into deadly poison.  I take back the world that I bore.  I suffocate the 
world that I bore between my thighs.  I bury it in my shame.  Down with the joy of 
submission.  Long live hate, contempt, rebellion, death.  When she  walks through your 
bedrooms carrying butcher knives you’ll know the truth. 
 
Exit men.  Ophelia remains on stage motionless in the white wrapping.
