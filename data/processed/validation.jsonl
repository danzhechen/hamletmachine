{"text":"of gold which they are supposed to replaceIn the history of the debasement of money in England and France by\ntheir governments, we find repeatedly that prices had not risen in the\nsame proportion in which the silver coinage had been debased That was\nsimply due to the fact that the proportion in which the currency was\nincreased did not correspond to the proportion in which it had been\ndebased; that is to say, because an inadequate quantity of coins of\nthe poorer metallic composition was issued, if the exchange values\nof commodities were to be estimated in the future in the new coin as\na measure of value and be realized in coins corresponding to this\nsmaller unit of measure This solves the difficulty left unsettled in\nthe controversy between Locke and Lowndes The ratio which a token\nof value, whether made of paper or of debased gold or silver, bears\nto certain weights of gold or silver estimated according to the mint\nprice, depends not on its own composition but on the quantity in which\nit is found in circulation The difficulty in understanding this is\ndue to the fact that money in its two functions of a measure of value\nand a medium of circulation is subject to two not only opposite but\napparently contradictory laws corresponding to the difference in the\ntwo functions In the discharge of its function of a measure of value\nwhere money serves merely as money of account and gold only as ideal\ngold, everything depends on the natural substance of money Estimated\nin silver or expressed in silver prices exchange values are naturally\nestimated quite differently than when measured in gold or as gold\nprices On the contrary, in its function of a medium of circulation,\nwhere gold is not only imagined but is actually present side by side\nwith other commodities, its substance is immaterial and everything\ndepends on its quantity For the unit of measure the determining factor\nis whether it consists of a pound of gold, silver or copper; while in\nthe case of coin, no matter what its own composition is, it will become\nthe embodiment of each of these units of measure in accordance with its\nquantity But it goes against common sense that in the case of mere\nimaginary money everything should depend on its material substance,\nwhile in that of the palpably present coin all should be determined by\nan ideal ratio of numbers","source_file":"DasKapital_ENG.txt","chunk_id":107,"text_length":2337,"token_count":481,"processing_timestamp":"2026-01-20T22:30:42.941797"}
